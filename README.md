# ‚öïÔ∏è HealthMate: AI Health Information Assistant & MCP Server

Welcome to HealthMate! This application leverages agentic AI workflows, orchestrated by LangGraph, to provide several healthcare-related information services. It also functions as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server, exposing tools that interact with publicly available health data APIs.

**Live Application:** [Link to your Hugging Face Space once deployed]

**Video Demonstration:** [Link to your video recording showing the UI workflows and MCP server in action with a client] *(You will need to create and host this video)*

## Disclaimer üìú

HealthMate is a technology demonstrator. The information provided is generated by AI, sourced from publicly available data (like PubMed, OpenFDA - often simulated for this demo), and is **NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.**

*   **Do NOT use HealthMate for actual medical decision-making or in emergencies.**
*   Always consult with qualified healthcare providers for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.
*   The outbreak monitoring feature is based on simplified text analysis and simulated data access; it is not a real-time epidemiological tool.

## Features ‚ú®

The application provides a user-friendly Gradio interface with three main functionalities:

1.  **üö® Outbreak Monitor (Simulated):**
    *   Analyzes input text (e.g., simulated news snippets, forum posts) for potential public health anomaly signals.
    *   Uses tools to detect symptoms, research related terms on PubMed, and check Health.gov (simulated) for relevant topics.
    *   Synthesizes a preliminary report with an assessed alert level.

2.  **üí° Health Information & Misinformation Check:**
    *   Responds to user health queries by fetching information from OpenFDA (for drugs), PubMed, and Health.gov (simulated for general topics).
    *   Optionally, allows users to input a specific health claim to be vetted against the retrieved information using a basic cross-referencing logic.

3.  **üè† Post-Discharge Information Support:**
    *   Offers general, non-personalized information related to user-specified conditions or medications, relevant for post-discharge care.
    *   Draws information from OpenFDA and Health.gov (simulated).

All workflows are orchestrated using **LangGraph**, allowing for complex, multi-step agentic behaviors.

## MCP Server Functionality ü§ñüîå

HealthMate also acts as an MCP Server, exposing underlying tools for programmatic access by MCP clients.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /mcp` (on the deployed Space URL)
*   **Request Format (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "your_tool_name",
      "tool_input": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Available Tools (via MCP):**
    *   `search_pubmed`:
        *   Input: `{"query": "string", "max_results": "int (optional, default 3)"}`
        *   Output: List of article dictionaries or error.
    *   `get_fda_drug_info`:
        *   Input: `{"drug_name": "string"}`
        *   Output: Drug information dictionary or error.
    *   `get_health_gov_topic`: (Simulated Data)
        *   Input: `{"topic_query": "string"}`
        *   Output: Health topic dictionary or error.
    *   `analyze_text_for_symptoms`: (Simplified Analysis)
        *   Input: `{"text": "string"}`
        *   Output: `{"symptoms_detected": ["symptom1", ...], "original_text_preview": "string"}` or error.

**Example MCP Client Call (using `curl`):**
```bash
curl -X POST https://[your-space-name].hf.space/mcp \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "tool_name": "search_pubmed",
           "tool_input": {"query": "diabetes management", "max_results": 1}
         }'
